Project: Landing Page

This landing page is a project to demonstrate all of the HTML and CSS skills that I have learned so far in The Odin Project.

The subject of the landing page is the provision of evidence-based information on how to live a healthy lifestyle.

The main topics of interest are:
    - Resistance training
    - Cardio
    - Diet
    - Sleep
